# 📚 Additional Documentation

**Important**: The official, up-to-date documentation is always in the root **README.md** file.

This folder contains supplementary materials and resources that support the main documentation.

## Purpose

- Deep-dive technical articles (future)
- Development guides (future)
- Architecture diagrams (future)
- API specifications (future)
- Deployment guides (future)

## Convention

**Keep README.md at root as the single source of truth for current project state.**

All other documentation in this folder is supplementary only and should not replace or duplicate information in the main README.md.

---

For the official project documentation, always refer to: **[README.md](../README.md)**
